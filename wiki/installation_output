Please make an entry to your crontab to match up with the desired time step (default 60 second)
  A default entry would look like : * * * * * /rc/hyperion/SlurmGraphing/scripts/cron_script.sh >> /rc/hyperion/SlurmGraphing/logs/master.log
Thank you for using the SlurmGraphing software. For any help please contact me at Michael.Luker@usu.edu
